# Data Power Hour Presentations

Welcome to the **Data Power Hour Presentations** repository! This space documents and showcases presentations designed to empower and support women returning to the workforce in the data field. Here, you’ll find resources curated and created by Sanya Syed and a dedicated team of three other women, all sharing the same journey of re-entering the workforce after a career break.  

## About Data Power Hour
The **Data Power Hour** is a collaborative, volunteer-led group of women who are passionate about data and dedicated to upskilling and supporting each other’s transition back into the workforce. Each member, many of whom are returners themselves, contributes actively to creating a supportive, growth-oriented environment. Together, we share projects, insights, learnings, and practical tools to navigate our professional journeys in data.

### Mission
This group’s mission is to:
- Provide meaningful learning sessions to refresh and expand our data skills.
- Build confidence through shared experiences, resources, and encouragement.
- Develop a portfolio of work, projects, and skills that showcase our readiness to re-enter the workforce.

Each week, the core team—Sanya and three other volunteers—leads discussions and shares presentations on topics tailored to support data professionals re-establishing their careers. These presentations cover practical and trending topics relevant for anyone looking to deepen their expertise or build a portfolio in data.
